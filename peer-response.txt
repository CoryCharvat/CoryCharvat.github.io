I really like the layout of your website. I love the navigation bar on the side 
of the screen, and I like how, when I scale it how the menu interacts with the 
size differences. The only detail I notice is that it looks like your {} image 
is clipart since I see a checked pattern in the back. I think it would look 
better to have the idea on a white background or the blue color you have for 
your nav menu. Other than that, great work! If you are worried about grammer issues 
in the future, consider using Grammarly, it is a free software that catches grammer 
errors. I use it to help me with my writing.

I like the simple design because it makes it easy to read. I also like how smooth the
 transitions are from section to section. Two things i would say that need to be fixed 
 are the education,contact and the languages section because they all lead to the same 
 place. Also the image in the top left does not seem to do anything. Other than that it
 is fine.

Oh one more I forgot to add. You may want to add a copyright somewhere in it.






My Fixes:

I Fiexed my img in my nav bar that had a white background and made it a clickable image that 
sent the user ro the home page for now till I have a better idea for that. I do want it clickable.

I did not add a copyright to the site because I think it is not neede and i did fix the 2 pages that
lead to the same webpage and addeed some material to thoes pages. 
and added photo credit to my references.

Hello Cory! I can see your pretty much finished with your website! Looking at your education tab you have
 many lists of oyur skills! If possible you can add 1 picture of your self in one of those categories. 
 For instance you have been part of the deli crew. If there is one add a picture of you working serving food! 
 since you have completed a variety of skills in the "computer/technical" filed maybe add 1 fact or picture you 
 are proud from your spare time ( building a computer, gaming setup, games etc.) Lastly adding a border, of your 
 information would be something fun! Like your website cory!!

 I dig your navigational bar! The white thing that follows the cursor around is pretty cool. 
 The overall layout is simple and put together well.

The thing I'd critique, however, is when you crunch down the window, part of your nav bar is inaccessible 
(see attachment). Which is unfortunate, cuz I love your nav bar!

Also, I'm only assuming you might use this as a professional resume of sorts, so I'm going to play
 English teacher a little bit and pick on the grammar and spelling. It's better that we address it now than when
  this website is live and sent to potential employers. I just want to give you a better chance at nabbing that job!

Without further ado:

Home page - "Abilitys" needs to be changed to "abilities".
Work page - "Extreamly" changed to "Extremely".
Education page
"Compleated" changed to "Completed".
"Programing" changed to "Programming".
"Into" changed to "Intro".
(Further down) "Compleated" changed to "Completed".
Languge page - "Languge" changed to "Language".
Note: I noticed your language HTML name is also spelled incorrectly, so be wary if you're going to change the spelling of the file name because it might break the page.
References page - I don't know if it's actually what it's called, but "Apetrure Strudios" to "Aperture Studios".
Anyway, I hope it didn't come off as harsh, but hope the spelling checks help. Good luck!

Hey Cory, 

Great website! Your passion shines through and it was a brilliant idea to use it to build your resume.
 I liked the use of Formspree to make a contact box and the "go back" button worked. I sent you a message on it, I hope it worked. 
 The navigation bar is just one of my favorite features on your website. I like that it's on the side in addition
  to it being aesthetically pleasing. I like when the page is made smaller it becomes just the icons. I also like your use of a table for your languages page. 

I went through the rubric and found you check off all the boxes. It was hard to find any critiques. So, here's what I've got for ya. . .

Usability (p. 506) Let the users know where they are. Starting out on your home page and common sense
 I think most users could figure out which page they are on. But for extra points sake, maybe putting headers on each page
  that states what it is or even highlighting the according nav menu section.
HTML Comments.  I did see a few comments here and there. I noticed more in the CSS than the HTML.
 To be honest, your HTML is clean and easy to read. I'm not sure you  really need more. If you do add more,
  I would comment out the sections. For example on the education or reference page you could comment out where code begins for each section. 
Responsive Web Design. Overall, everything worked well and was laid out properly at all sizes of screen I used.
 The only thing that stuck out to me was on the references page. When I made my screen size smaller,
  the email addresses for Lindsey and William sit to the right of their photos. Whereas Kelly and Tanner's emails fall below their images. I like the latter better. 
Lastly, the email addresses on the references page are a little to small to read
