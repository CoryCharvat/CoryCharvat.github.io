I really like the layout of your website. I love the navigation bar on the side 
of the screen, and I like how, when I scale it how the menu interacts with the 
size differences. The only detail I notice is that it looks like your {} image 
is clipart since I see a checked pattern in the back. I think it would look 
better to have the idea on a white background or the blue color you have for 
your nav menu. Other than that, great work! If you are worried about grammer issues 
in the future, consider using Grammarly, it is a free software that catches grammer 
errors. I use it to help me with my writing.

I like the simple design because it makes it easy to read. I also like how smooth the
 transitions are from section to section. Two things i would say that need to be fixed 
 are the education,contact and the languages section because they all lead to the same 
 place. Also the image in the top left does not seem to do anything. Other than that it
 is fine.

Oh one more I forgot to add. You may want to add a copyright somewhere in it.






My Fixes:
I Fiexed my img in my nav bar that had a white background and made it a clickable image that 
sent the user ro the home page for now till I have a better idea for that. I do want it clickable.

I did not add a copyright to the site because I think it is not neede and i did fix the 2 pages that
lead to the same webpage and addeed some material to thoes pages. 
and added photo credit to my references.
